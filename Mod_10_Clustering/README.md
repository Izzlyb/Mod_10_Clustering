The application machine learning models to analyze data. In this project we used K-means and PCA to create the models to analyze the data.


# Background
We are to assume the role of an advisor in one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. Competitors are 
fierce, so you want to propose a novel approach to assembling investment portfolios that are based on cryptocurrencies. 
Instead of basing your proposal on only returns and volatility, you want to include other factors that might impact 
the crypto marketâ€”leading to better performance for your portfolio.
